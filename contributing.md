# Contributing Guidelines

## Try to keep everything simple:

- Double check if the resource is truly free without any kind of hidden surprises.

- Add single resource in one pull request as it will allow for easier review.

- Pull request title should include resource name and resource section/category.
  - Example: `[Eloquent JavaScript] in [books]`

- Provide a link to submitted resource in pull request comment section for easier access without copy paste.
  - Example: `https://eloquentjavascript.net/`

- Sample of a resource submission: `**[Eloquent JavaScript](https://eloquentjavascript.net/ "A modern introduction to programming by Marijn Haverbeke")**`

- write any additional information in the comment section of pull request.
